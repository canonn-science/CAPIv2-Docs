# About

The Canonn API was built in order to catelog all the science and mystery related to Elite Dangerous, like many other APIs that run the backbone of the EDCD group. Our goal is simply to offer our findings in such a way that other developers may use our data quickly and easily in their own projects while also being able to contribute to our data.

## The Framework we use

The Canonn API is being built using a new API Framework (Headless CMS) called [Strapi](https://strapi.io) with the goal being have a common framework to make development easier and more open to anyone. If you are also interested in using or help building on the framework you can take a look at their [Github](https://github.com/strapi/strapi).

As a footnote, us at R&D wanted to thank all the contributors and the Strapi team themselves for building and maintaining such a great project!
