## About

The Canonn API was built in order to catelog all the science and mystery related to Elite Dangerous, like many other APIs that run the backbone of the EDCD group. Our goal is simply to offer our findings in such a way that other developers may use our data quickly and easily in their own projects while also being able to contribute to our data.

## Our Github Repos

All of our projects are open sourced and licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 license and can be viewed on our github:

* [Canonn-Science Repo](https://github.com/canonn-science)
